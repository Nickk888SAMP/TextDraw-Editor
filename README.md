# TextDrawEditor
NTD is a TextDraw editor, inspired by iPLEOMAX's TextDraw editor he made a few years ago, the goal was to make a easy to use, straight forward TextDraw editor, the script contains a lot of cool features, more then the original editor by iPLEOMAX!

- Clickable interface.
- Multilanguage support (English, Polish and German natively included)
- Player Progress Bar Support(With Color and Max Percentage settings!)
- Build-in Sprite selector(Over 300 sprites!).
- Preview Model and Sprites support.
- Changeable TextDraw variable name in-game.
- Over 35 Pre-made colors to choose.
- Fully customizable interface(Button colors, override colors & interface position).
- TextDraw templates(Pre-made TextDraws to choose and create your own!).
- Quick Selection tool(Just select your TextDraw! No need to search within the Dialog!).
- TextDraw visibility option(If you want to show other players your work!).
- Fully editable Preview Model(Rotation, Zoom, ID and colors!).
- Easy export your project(Simple export or Self-working Script).
- Quick, fluid and stable working environment.
- File based language and templates system(Add new languages without code interaction!).
